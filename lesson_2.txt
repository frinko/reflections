What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you make it available to start tracking
changes to the files contained within. You have to initialize it before
you can start committing changes to the files. You also will not be able
to see any changes, nor be able to view logs of commits - because there
will not be any commits yet.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository
because it is a virtual (but still physical) place where the files ready to 
be committed are placed so that they are separated visually whenever the user
runs the "git status" command. I think that the value is that the difference
of files shows up visually to the user. This is much like the commit window
of our CVS system that shows which files are being committed to the repository.
