When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository whenever I had to share a project with other
people that were not located near me. For example, if the other contributers were
located in a different town, or even country then they would not have access to the
files on my local site. Even if I used a repository that was located on a company's
premises, it would still limit the ability of the people to work and commit code if
they were not on site - unless they went through all of the access controls to
establish a remote session, etc.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think that you might want to always pull changes manually as opposed to having them
stay in sync automatically because your local copy would always have the updates that
you were currently working on and if you have not committed them yet, and the repos
were set to keep in sync automatically, then there would be the chance to have your
updates or changes overwritten. This would be horrible and could make you loose your
work that you were working on and then you would have to manually remember what you 
were updating and then have to update it again. Also, I think that it follows common
reasoning and a logical flow that the remote repo is the final storage location, or 
can even be thought of as a stable branch - even though you can have multiple branches
for this concept.
